# Randomly Subset a FASTA file

Write a Python program called `sampler.py` that will probabilistically sample one or more input FASTA files into an output directory.

The inputs for this program will be generated by your `moog.py` program.
You can run `make fasta` to create files of 1K, 10K, 100K, and 1M reads in this directory.
You can then use these files for testing your program.

The parameters for your program are:

* One or more positional FILE arguments
* `-p`|`--pct`: a `float` value between 0 and 1 which is the percentage of reads to take (default `0.1` or 10%)
* `-s`|`--seed`: an `int` value to use for the random seed (default `None`)
* `-o`|`--outdir`: an `str` value to use for the output directory (default `'out'`). You will need to create this directory if it does not exist. Consult your `transcribe.py` program to see how to do that.

Here is the usage your program should create for `-h` or `--help`:

```
$ ./sampler.py -h
usage: sampler.py [-h] [-p reads] [-s seed] [-o DIR] FILE [FILE ...]

Probabalistically subset FASTA files

positional arguments:
  FILE                  Input FASTA file(s)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p reads, --pct reads
                        Percent of reads (default: 0.1)
  -s seed, --seed seed  Random seed value (default: None)
  -o DIR, --outdir DIR  Output directory (default: out)
```

When run with the `n1k.fa`, it should print this:

```
$ ./sampler.py n1k.fa -s 1
  1: n1k.fa
Wrote 95 sequences from 1 file to directory "out"
```

Here is an example of the output for multiple files:

```
$ ./sampler.py -p .25 -s 4 n1k.fa n10k.fa n100k.fa -o sampled
  1: n1k.fa
  2: n10k.fa
  3: n100k.fa
Wrote 27,688 sequences from 3 files to directory "sampled"
```

To parse the FASTA files, you will need to add this import statement:

```
from Bio import SeqIO
```

If you have not already install BioPython, you will need to do so:

```
$ python3 -m pip install biopython
```

Or run:

```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
